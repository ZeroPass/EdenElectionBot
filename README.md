# Up Vote Bot
We are running the [Up Vote Bot in Telegram](https://t.me/Up_Vote_Bot).  
Read about the progress and donate at [pomelo.io/grants/bot4eden](https://pomelo.io/grants/bot4eden).


## Additional info:
- Bot has badge/text - 'has access to messages' - we cannot remove it because of admin rights (also changing privacy mode (in Botfather chat) to ONE cannot remote this badge). If bot has admin rights automatic gets the badge (https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#what-messages-will-my-bot-get)

- Sending limit is around 30 messages per second (https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#how-can-i-message-all-of-my-bot-39s-subscribers-at-once)
- We detected the limit of 'group creation action' (around 50 groups per dey per bot)
- Renaming group has limit around 8 groups in one actions set (rename every ~30 seconds)
